# Springboard-FDS-Capstone-submission
Springboard Foundations of Data Science Capstone project - final submission

# Project description
This analysis is a proof-of-concept using data science techniques in a sports analytics context; to predict and interpret winning factors in Australian-rules Football League (AFL) from player performance metrics.

## Sourcing raw data
**Player performance metrics** - used as independent x variables - were scraped with code.

- Code: *code-01-scrape-xvars-playermetrics.R*
- Saved data: *player_metrics.Rda*

**Team results** - used as dependent y variable - were manually copied and formatted initially in Excel. Some wrangling was done in R to interpret the scores from the unique AFL string format of goals.behinds

- Excel prep: *match-results-prep.xlsx*
- Code: *code-02-prepare-yvars-matchresults.R*
- Saved data: *team_results.Rda*

## Data wrangling, Exploratory Analysis and Feature Engineering
Steps required to merge raw data into meaningful data frames, perform visualisation and initial statistical analysis for exploration of data relationships and generate indices (features) of the data to facilitate deeper analysis.

- Code: *code-03-datawrangling-EDA.R*
